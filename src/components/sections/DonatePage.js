        This app is free and open source for everyone and It doesn't show any
        ads because I wanted to keep it like that, But there are servers running
        and many other things which comes to a cost and I need to pay for those. So, I would be so grateful is you could donate me somewhat bucks.
        
        It would be really helpful if you could donate and help me keep doing
        what I do. Thanks‚Ä¶
